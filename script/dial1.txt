<Tella>: <Anna>!<New>
<Anna>: Father, <Gilbart> is... the prince of Damcyan. Forgive me, Father, for running away... but I love <Gilbart>.<New>
Still, I knew I couldn't find happiness... without your consent. I was going to come home, but...<New>
<Gilbart>: Baron's Red Wings, led by <Golbeza>, blitzed us.<New>
<Cecil>: I've never heard of <Golbeza>. Who is he?<New>
<Gilbart>: I don't know. His powers were beyond words.<New>
<Cecil>: But why did they attack Damcyan?<New>
<Gilbart>: They wanted the Crystal, and they spared no one to get it. My mother, my father... <Anna> shielded me from their arrows...<End>

shortly.<New>
<Cecil>: ...Alright.<End>

Crew: The captain seems kinda down.<New>
Crew: After what we did, who wouldn't be?
I mean orders are orders, but killing
innocent people to get the Crystals...?<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 34>
Crew: But, Captain!<New>
Crew: Surely you don't condone what we've done, Captain?<New>
<Cecil>: All of you, listen well. The raid on Mysidia was imperative.<New>
His Majesty and his council concluded that the Mysidians, who know much about the Crystals, posed a serious threat to our kingdom.<New>
For Baron to prosper, we need the Crystals. As soldiers of the Royal Air Force, we must achieve this by any means necessary.<New>
Crew: Captain!<End>

<Text entry 42>
Baigan: Your Majesty, I'm afraid <Cecil> can no longer be trusted. He clearly questions your authority.<New>
King: I suspected as much. It matters not, so long as I get the Crystals. Send him in.<New>
Baigan: Yes, Your Majesty.<End>

<Text entry 50>
<Cecil>: Your Majesty, forgive me, but what do you intend? The men are confused-- some, even displeased.<New>
King: And you? You question my command?<New>
<Cecil>: No! I only--<New>
King: Silence! Dissension only leads to treason, and that, I will not tolerate. I hereby relieve you of command of the Red Wings.<End>
<End of Block>

King: Now, I charge you with another duty. Slay the Eidolon that infests the Mist Valley, and deliver this Carnelian Signet to the village Mist.<New>
You leave tomorrow, at first light.<End>

King: You insolent cur! How dare you barge in here!? If you're so concerned about him, by all means, accompany him! Now, take the ring and begone!<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 55>
<Cecil>: I'm sorry, <Cain>.<New>
<Cain>: Don't worry. After we finish this task, you'll be flying again in no time.<New>
<Cecil>: ...<New>
<Cain>: Get some rest. Leave tomorrow's preparations to me.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 56>
<Cain>: What's wrong?<New>
<Cecil>: Nothing...except that I dragged you into one hell of a mess.<New>
<Cain>: Yeah, what else is new? Kidding.<New>
<Cecil>: I mastered the dark sword at His Majesty's orders. But it was to protect Baron, not to plunder.<New>
<Cain>: Don't get yourself down over this. I'm sure the king had his reasons.<New>
<Cecil>: I envy you, <Cain>-- the path you chose.<New>
<Cain>: I'm just following in my father's footsteps. I suppose I could've attained higher rank had I become a dark knight, but this suits me better.<New>
<Cecil>: ...<New>
<Cain>: Don't think too much, and get some rest already. We rise early tomorrow. Hey, 500 Gil says I slay that Eidolon tomorrow.<New>
<Cecil>: Alright, you're on.<End>

<Rosa>: <Cecil>!<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 58>
<Rosa>: Thank goodness you're alright. I was so worried. You and your men left on such short notice.<New>
<Cecil>: We're okay... I wish I could say the same for the Mysidians...<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 59>
<Rosa>: I'll visit you later, okay?<New>
<Cecil>: Alright...<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 60>
<Cecil>: What's happened to the king? He covets the Crystals as though he's possessed... and he'll resort to any means to get them.<New>
Nevertheless, I can't defy him. How could I cross the man who raised <Cain> and me like his very own?<New>
The chivalrous knight whom I've adored and admired since childhood? I will not betray him. I can't.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 61>
<Rosa>: What's going on? You just returned from Mysidia, and now you must leave again to battle this Eidolon.<New>
<Cecil>: Don't worry.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 62>
<Rosa>: <Cecil>, look at me.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 63>
<Cecil>: In Mysidia, we killed innocent people to steal their... It was horrible.<New>
I guess it's my fate as a dark knight. Soon, I won't even feel any remorse for my actions.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 64>
<Rosa>: You and I both know that would never happen.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 65>

Guard: Yes, sir!<End>

<Text entry 73>
<Cecil>: <Yang>! What's wrong!?<New>
<Yang>: You insolent wretch!<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 74>
<Yang>: <Cecil>! What just happened? After Leviathan attacked us...I cannot remember anything.<New>
<Tella>: Obviously, you suffered a slight case of amnesia and were being used by Baron.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 75>
<Yang>: <Rydia> was swallowed by Leviathan. I don't know what happened to <Gilbart>.<New>
<Cecil>: I see.<End>

<End of Block>

<Text entry 78>
<Porom>: <Palom>! Apologize!<New>
<Yang>: No, he is right. Forgive my actions.<New>
<Cecil>: Well, first things first. We have to find <Cid>.<New>
<Tella>: Sneaking into the castle won't be easy.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 79>
<Cecil>: This is the Baron Key! Of course! They must've given it to you when they gave you command of those guards. With this key, I believe we'll be able to find <Cid>.<New>

<Cecil>: What!?<New>
<Cain>: People with the power to summon monsters-- the summoners... They really exist.<New>
<Cecil>: Then...her mother died because we killed the dragon.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 86>
Girl: You killed my mom's dragon!!?<New>
<Cecil>: We didn't know. I'm...I'm sorry.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 87>
<Cain>: So this is the king's wish...to annihilate every summoner in this village. ...I'm afraid we have to take care of her, too.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 88>
<Cecil>: WHAT!?<New>
<Cain>: I know, but it's the king's orders.<New>
<Cecil>: <Cain>! She's just a child!<New>
<Cain>: You intend to defy the king?<New>
<Cecil>: I refuse to continue this slaughter in the king's name!<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 89>
<Cain>: Damn... I was afraid you'd say that. Well, I can't kill you, so I might as well join you.<New>
<Cecil>: <Cain>.<New>
<Cain>: I owe the king so much, but I can't disgrace the dragon knights. Not on my life.<New>
<Cecil>: I guess we're both traitors hereon.<New>
<Cain>: Opposing the mightiest kingdom in the land... We'll need allies to survive. We have to rescue <Rosa> somehow, too.<New>
<Cecil>: Thanks, <Cain>.<New>
<Cain>: Save it. I'm not doing it for you.<New>
<Cecil>: ...<End>

<Rosa>: <Cecil>. You're alive!<New>
<Cecil>: How do you feel?<New>
<Rosa>: I'm fine. I thought...<Music 19><New>
I had lost you. Weren't you in Mist when the earthquake struck?<New>
<Cecil>: Yeah. I'm sorry I worried you... <Rosa>, who is <Golbeza>?<New>
<Rosa>: He's the new captain of the Red Wings, appointed by the king himself. The king has not been himself lately.<New>
I believe <Golbeza> is manipulating him to collect the Crystals for himself.<New>
With Mysidia's Water Crystal in hand, he'll surely go after the other three-- the Fire Crystal of Damcyan, the Wind Crystal of Fabul, and the Earth Crystal of Troia.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 106>
<Gilbart>: The Fire Crystal has already fallen into his hands.<New>
<Cecil>: <Gilbart> is the prince of Damcyan. And <Rydia> is a summoner of Mist. I couldn't have gotten the Sand Pearl to cure your fever without their help.<New>
<Rydia>: Hi.<New>
<Rosa>: Hello, <Rydia>. Thank you both so much. <Cecil>, after Damcyan, their next target must be Fabul. We must--ugh!<End>

<Text entry 107>
<Cecil>: You have to rest now. Don't worry. We'll go to Fabul.<New>
<Gilbart>: But to reach Fabul, we must traverse Mt. Hobs, and the trail is blocked by thick ice.<End>

<Text entry 108>
<Rosa>: <Rydia>, can you cast Fire?<New>
<Rydia>: ...No.<End>

<Gilbart>: NO! Don't go! I love you! Please, <Anna>! Don't go!<End>

<Tella>: Fast asleep. She must have been very tired. Where is her home?<New>
<Cecil>: Mist Village.<New>
<Tella>: She seems very gifted. With proper training, she'll be able to master many spells. Look at her. She looks so adorable...reminds me of <Anna>, years ago.<New>
<Cecil>: <Anna> is...<New>
<Tella>: My only daughter. She eloped with a bard to Damcyan, because I didn't consent to their union.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 116>
<Tella>: What business have you in Damcyan?<New>
<Cecil>: A friend of mine suffers from desert fever.<New>
<Tella>: You need the Sand Pearl. Acquiring it won't be easy.<New>
<Cecil>: Tell me more about this monster we must face.<New>
<Tella>: A vicious creature with eight huge tentacles. We must kill it quickly and reach Damcyan before it's too late.<New>
<Cecil>: Too late for what?<New>
<Tella>: I don't know. I only pray my instincts are wrong...<End>

King: How do you know this?<New>

King: And these others?<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 125>
<Cecil>: Sir, we haven't much time. The castle's defense must be tightened immediately.<New>
King: <Yang>, can we trust this dark knight and his companions?<New>

<Gilbart>: I am honored to see you again.<New>
King: Prince <Gilbart>!<New>
<Gilbart>: Sire, Baron's fleet decimated Damcyan and claimed our Crystal not long ago. Many died, including my parents...And my beloved. Damcyan's tragedy must not be repeated!<End>

<Center>And so, the dark knight
<Center><Cecil> was stripped of his
<Center>command as captain of the
<Center>Red Wings. He and the
<Center>dragon knight <Cain> head
<Center>toward the dark valley for
<Center>the village Mist.



<Center>The advent of the airship
<Center>marked the realization
<Center>of Baron's dreams, but
<Center>also the birth of
<Center>its militarism.



<Center>With its Royal Air Force
<Center>"Red Wings," Baron soon
<Center>reigned supreme. Now, as
<Center>monsters multiply and stir
<Center>unrest, Baron only exploits
<Center>its power to collect the
<Center>world's Crystals. Why?






<Center>The Crystals shed their
<Center>light silently...
