<Text entry 58>
Elder: Knight of Baron... What do you want this time?<New>
<Cecil>: My name is <Cecil>. ...I can't begin to ask you to forgive me for what I've done.<New>
Elder: Apologies will not bring the dead back to life.<New>
<Cecil>: ...<New>
Elder: So...you have mourned and suffered as we have... You are not the mindless killer you once were. What brings you here?<New>
<Cecil>: A sorcerer named <Golbeza> now commands Baron's forces, and took my friend captive. While en route to Baron to rescue her, my companions and I were attacked by Leviathan. I was shipwrecked here, and I don't know what's become of the others.<New>
Elder: I sense your trials are just beginning. But while you depend upon the dark sword, you cannot overcome true evil. Moreover, you might be consumed by its darkness someday. If you wish to fight evil with righteousness, go to Mt. Ordeals, which lies to the east of Mysidia.<New>
<Cecil>: But my comrades...<New>
Elder: There is a time for everything. First, you must climb Mt. Ordeals and renounce this evil sword for a holy sword. Only then can you receive light and become a holy knight-- a paladin. Many have ventured to Ordeals to become a paladin, but none have ever returned. Will you risk your life as well and go to Ordeals?<New>
<Cecil>: Yes.<New>
Elder: You face heavy odds by going alone. I will assign two mages to accompany you. <Palom>! <Porom>!<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 59>
Thank you for coming. <End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 60>
<Cecil>: ...Who are you?<New>
Old Man: I am <Fusuya>, guardian of the Lunarians.<New>
<Rosa>: Lunarians?<New>
<Fusuya>: In eons past, a planet between Mars and Jupiter verged on extinction. The survivors escaped by ship to the blue planet.<New>
<Cecil>: The blue planet...? Our home?<New>
<Fusuya>: Yes, Earth. But because the people of Earth were still evolving, the survivors created another moon, where they now sleep.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 61>
<Edge>: So these survivors became Lunarians, and they're still sleeping.<New>
<Fusuya>: Some were reluctant. One even schemed to destroy life on Earth and usurp the planet.<New>
<Rydia>: My gosh...<New>
<Fusuya>: I forced him to sleep, but even through long repose, the power of his will continues to grow. That very will has further corrupted evil souls, inciting them to gather the Crystals.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 62>
<Cecil>: <Golbeza> being one of them.<New>
<Edge>: So who is this guy?<New>
<Fusuya>: Zemus. He plans to use the Crystals, our source of energy, to restore the Tower of Babil and bring down the Giant of Babil to annihilate life on Earth.<New>
<Rosa>: Insane...<New>
<Fusuya>: Such is not the Lunarians' wish. They quietly wait for earthlings to evolve, and long to commune with them one day.<New>
<Cecil>: How did the Lunar Whale come into being?<New>
<Fusuya>: My brother KluYa made it long ago to go to the blue planet, which he had longed to visit. He introduced the concept of airships and the Devil's Road to your people. Moreover, he fell in love with an earthling. She bore two children. You are one.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 63>
Apprentices: Aye, aye!<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 64>
<Cecil>: !! I'm... Then that voice at Mt. Ordeals was--<New>
<Fusuya>: The spirit of your father, no doubt. You resemble KluYa.<New>
<Cecil>: That light...was my father...<New>
<Fusuya>: KluYa gave you his power to fight Zemus. We must stop him for the sake of our two races. Now let us depart for the Tower of Babil.<New>
<Edge>: The tower's shielded.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 65>
<Fusuya>: I can neutralize the barrier. Come, we have little time.<New>

<End of Block>

<Text entry 66>
<Cain>: Zeromus's last words... What do you think...?<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 67>
<Rosa>: As long as evil dwells in the hearts...<New>
<Fusuya>: In every heart, there resides good and evil... just as the Crystals of light and dark exist, just as the overworld and underworld together form the Earth. Against evil will, good will arises; thus did you overcome Zemus.<New>
<Edge>: Ahh, it was nothin'. I was born a hero.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 68>
<Rydia>: Could you be more arrogant!? I'm surprised Zemus didn't control you.<End>

<Text entry 72>
<Cecil>: We are going home.<New>
<Rosa>: Our friends are waiting.<End>

<Text entry 73>

<End of Block>

<Text entry 74>
<Golbeza>: I wish to accompany you.<New>
<Fusuya>: You?<New>
<Golbeza>: I cannot go back-- not after what I've done. And I long to know more about the Lunarians, my father's people.<New>
<Fusuya>: Ah, yes--you are half Lunarian. A long sleep awaits us, mind you.<New>
<Golbeza>: I have no qualms.<End>
<End of Block>

<Text entry 75>
<Golbeza>: You called me "brother."<New>
<Cecil>: ...<New>
<Golbeza>: I have caused you much pain... I cannot expect your forgiveness.<End>
