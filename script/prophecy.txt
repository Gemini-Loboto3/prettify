One born of a dragon,
bearing darkness and
light, shall rise to
the heavens over the
still land.

Bathing the moon in
eternal light, he brings
a promise to Mother Earth
with bounty and grace.

But someday the moon
shall depart, seeking
its own light. The sons
of moon and Earth shall
then part, divided by
the flow of time.<End>
